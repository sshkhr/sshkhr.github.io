I gave a talk on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using methods from Cognitive Science to the Data Science Club at my alma mater, Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad. This talk was based on work done by advisor/collaborator Eric J Taylor and myself for our CVPR workshop paper: [Response Time Analysis for Explainability of Visual Processing in CNNs](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2020/papers/w26/Taylor_Response_Time_Analysis_for_Explainability_of_Visual_Processing_in_CNNs_CVPRW_2020_paper.pdf).
