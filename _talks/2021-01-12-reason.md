I gave two talks summarizing the ICLR 2020 paper [What Can Neural Networks Reason About?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13211). This paper proposes a theoretical framework to understand the role of inductive biases on the ability of neural networks to reason about problems which have algorithmic solutions.
