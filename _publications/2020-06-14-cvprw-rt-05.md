We adapt response time evaluation in human psychophysics for deep learning to calculate Neural Response Times (NRT) by profiling dynamic DNNs. We verify that NRT is able to corroborate known effects about the feature space composed by object recognition models when tested on OOD view points. We further demonstrate that NRT can be used to causally verify Scene Grammar effects in identifying semantic and syntactic inconsistencies across visual scenes.
