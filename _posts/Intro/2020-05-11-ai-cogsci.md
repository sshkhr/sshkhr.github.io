I recently had a chance to attend (virtually) the workshop "Bridging AI and Cognitive Science" at the International Conference on Learning Representations. This blog post tries to capture how the two fields are closely interrelated and also summarizes my takeaways from the talks and some of the papers presented at the workshop.

## The synergy between AI and Cognitive Science


## The role of 'play' in learning
First up was [Prof Laura Shulz]([http://eccl.mit.edu/people.htm](http://eccl.mit.edu/people.htm)) who talked about the role of play in animal and human learning from the perspective of a developmental psychologist.

## Does brain represent space in terms of successor representations ? 


## "Brain-like" replay to address catastrophic forgetting 


## What can robotics and cognitive science learn from each other?

Prof Leslie Kaelbling


## Children vs Agents in a Reinforcement Learning environment
