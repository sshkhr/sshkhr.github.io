Hello! I am a researcher in computer vision and machine learning. My present research focus is explainable artificial intelligence and cognitive-science inspired computer vision. I blog about similar topics and also maths and programming in general.

Presently, I am a master's student at the University of Guelph and Vector Institute. I am working with [Prof Graham Taylor](https://www.gwtaylor.ca/) at the Machine Learning Research Group. Before this, I was a research assistant at the [Visual Computing Lab](http://visual-computing.in/home/) at the Indian Institute Of Science working with [Prof Anirban Chakraborty](http://visual-computing.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/anirban-chakraborty.html) and [Prof Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/). I did my bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute Of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad in 2017. I have also spent time working in the industry at Samsung Research Institute Delhi, Shell R&D Center Bangalore, HyperWorks Imaging Bangalore for a total of two years.
