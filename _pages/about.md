Hello! I am a researcher in computer vision and machine learning. My present research focus is understanding visual representations. I blog about similar topics and also maths and programming in general.

Presently, I am an AI Resident at Facebook AI Research working with [Dr. Ari Morcos](http://www.arimorcos.com/) and [Priya Goyal](https://research.fb.com/people/goyal-priya/). Before this, I was master's student at the University of Guelph and Vector Institute, working with [Prof Graham Taylor](https://www.gwtaylor.ca/) at the Machine Learning Research Group. Even further back, I was a research assistant at the [Visual Computing Lab](http://visual-computing.in/home/) at the Indian Institute Of Science working with [Prof Anirban Chakraborty](http://visual-computing.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/anirban-chakraborty.html) and [Prof Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/). I did my bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute Of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad in 2017. I have also spent time working in the industry either working or collaborating with NEXT-AI Toronto, Layer6 AI Toronto, Shell R&D Center Bangalore, HyperWorks Imaging Bangalore and Samsung Research Institute Delhi.
