Hello! I am a researcher in computer vision and machine learning.

I work at Meta (Facebook) AI Research with [Dr. Ari Morcos](http://www.arimorcos.com/) on scaling laws, self-supervised computer vision, and foundation models. Before this, I was master's student at the University of Guelph and Vector Institute, working with [Prof Graham Taylor](https://www.gwtaylor.ca/) at the Machine Learning Research Group. Even further back, I was a research assistant at the [Visual Computing Lab](http://visual-computing.in/home/) at the Indian Institute Of Science working with [Prof Anirban Chakraborty](http://visual-computing.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/anirban-chakraborty.html) and [Prof Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/). I did my bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute Of Technology Dhanbad in 2017. Besides these experiences, I have over 3 years of experience in machine learning and computer vision working with NEXT-AI Toronto, Layer6 AI Toronto, Shell R&D Center Bangalore, HyperWorks Imaging Bangalore, & Samsung Research Institute Delhi.
