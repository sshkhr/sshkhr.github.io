Hello there, internet friend! You have stumbled upon Shashank's personal website. Please feel free to look around.

Presently, I am pursuing my masters's at the University of Guelph. I am enrolled in the [collaborative specialization in artificial intelligence](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ceps/csai) where I am free to take courses in maths, statistics, computer science, and engineering. Needless to say, I'm having a great time during my master's. This is also facilitated by the fact that I have an excellent mentor in my thesis advisor [Prof Graham Taylor](https://www.gwtaylor.ca/) as well as an extremely stimulating environment for AI research at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

Before starting my master's, I spent a year and a half working as a research assistant at the [Visual Computing Lab](http://visual-computing.in/home/) at the Department Of Computational and Data Sciences at Indian Institute Of Science. I was quite lucky to have excellent mentors in [Prof Anirban Chakraborty](http://visual-computing.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/anirban-chakraborty.html) and [Prof Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/) (who is now at Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur)

Going back further, I did my bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute Of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad in 2017. I also spent working in the industry at Samsung Research Institute Delhi, Shell R&D Center Bangalore, HyperWorks Imaging Bangalore for short stints.

My master's research is focused on visual representation learning. Some of the topics I'm currently working on are: resource efficient learning (few/zero-shot learning and knowledge distillation), learning disentangled representations, building dynamic inference models, and explainability of AI decision-making using methods from cognitive science. I am a huge proponent of self-study as a lot of my knowledge about AI comes from online courses.

This portfolio and blog section is still under construction. Your patience is greatly appreciated!
